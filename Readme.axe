Configuring compilers
=======================================

Current release of AXE requires C++11 compliant compiler. The library
was tested with Visual C++ 2010 compiler and gcc 4.7.2. 
In order to use AXE library in Visual C++ projects, a path to the library 
sources must be specified. In Visual C++ 2010 the library path can be specifies in 
Project/Properties/Configuration Properties/C/C++/Additional Include Directories.
C++ files which use AXE library should include axe.h header.
AXE is a header-only library, and thus it doesn't require linking.

=======================================
Known issues
=======================================

When using gcc version 4.6.x compiler, declaration auto rules in template functions causes 
conversion error, see:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6399363/can-auto-type-deduction-possibly-cause-conversion-error

To avoid this problem, an axe::r_rule<Iterator> type can be used instead of "auto".
This issue has been fixed in gcc-4.7.0
